Analysis of DNA Sequence Classification Using Neural Networks: This project used DT, Naive Bayes, KNN, and a Random Forest Classifier to determine precision.
and accuracy. We got maximum accuracy in the naive Bayes classifier, around 98%. Also used clustering and feature selections. We split our human dataset.
into two parts: train_data and test_data. We had collected our dataset from Kaggle.
